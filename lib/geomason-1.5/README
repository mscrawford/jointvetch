GeoMason has a dependency on the Java Topology Suite (JTS).  Building
GeoMason presumes that you have a JTS jar file in your java class
path.

The JTS main web site is http://tsusiatsoftware.net/jts/main.html.

Also, GeoMason has optional dependencies on GeoTools and GDAL/OGR for
their respective importers.  GeoTools can be downloaded from
http://geotools.org and OGR can be downloaded from http://gdal.org/.
Note that in OGR's case you will not only have to include the jar file
in the class path but also ensure that the shared libraries are
properly installed as well as the corresponding JNI file.

If you wish to enable GeoTools or OGR GeoMason support, then uncomment
the corresponding make file variable in the "jar" rule.

And, GeoMason obviously has a dependency on Mason, so please ensure
that it is included in your class path, too.

allocation parameters to better fit available memory.
